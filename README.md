# Language Immersion App

A web-app that provides in context examples for your target language.

Examples can be:
- Text (pdfs, etc.)
- Audio (song lyrics, podcasts)
- Video (YouTube, downloaded media, etc.)

Ingests your provided media into a vocab set and then uses spaced repetition methods to prompt you with practice examples.

## Usage
